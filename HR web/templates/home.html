        <p style="color: brown;"> Predictive data analytics are everywhere. It is in its essence
            a technology that learns from existing data, and it uses this
            to forecast individual behavior. This means that predictions
            are very specific.

             So how do these predictive analytics work? Predictive analytics
             involves a set of various statistical (data mining) techniques
             that analyze historical data and outcomes. These techniques then
             try to create a formula, or algorithm, that best mimics these
             historical outcomes. This algorithm then uses current data to
             predict outcomes in the future.</br>

             <br>The objective of this project is to build a salary
             prediction dashboard for HRs </br>

             <br>In this project we are planning to create a dashboard
             that predict the salary when the employee switch jobs. Using
             past data, we can predict the salary of employees when the
             transfer jobs. This system provides HR to better estimate
             salaries of new employees and to making informative
             decisions/suggestions.</br>

             <br>The information collected includes data on age,
             gender, workclass, education, number of education, native country,
             marital status, employment, etc.</br></p>
